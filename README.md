# React Json View modified

This react app will show up two views, the first one will show you the original JSON.stringify and the other view will show you a JSON.stringify modified with .replace().

The idea of this project is to present to the client a simple way you could show the info, the JSON.stringify as it is, It's a good way to show the information. With this example I just show you that you could do a step forward on what you want to be visualized on your project.
